# Four-VSCMG Spacecraft Simulator (Pyramid Configuration)

This repository provides a MATLAB-based simulation of a spacecraft equipped with four Variable Speed Control Moment Gyroscopes (VSCMGs) in a pyramid configuration. The simulator models nonlinear spacecraft attitude dynamics, gimbal angles, and wheel speeds, and includes a 3D visualization of spacecraft motion.

## üìÇ How to Use
1. Run **`VscmgSim.m`**  
   - This generates simulation plots for:  
     - Spacecraft attitude  
     - Wheel speeds  
     - Gimbal angles  

2. Run **`Visualizations.m`**  
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Must run **`VscmgSim.m`** first to generate simulation data  
   - Provides a 3D visualization of spacecraft motion and VSCMG actuator dynamics
